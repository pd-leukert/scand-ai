# Decision log

Running log of decisions that were genuinely contested — where a reasonable person would
have chosen differently, or where we knowingly accepted a cost. Append, never rewrite:
if a decision is reversed, add a new entry that supersedes the old one and mark the old
one accordingly. (The irony of keeping a decision log with provenance and supersession for
a project about decision logs with provenance and supersession is not lost on us.)

**Anyone working in this repo, human or agent, adds an entry here when they make a call
that was not already written down.** If you found yourself weighing two options, that is
an entry. Cost of writing one: two minutes. Cost of not: the Sunday conversation where
nobody remembers why.

Entry format: number, date, status, the decision, what we rejected, why, what it costs us.

**Per-document extraction, aggregated into one statements file.**

Each document is processed independently by the LLM; the results are concatenated into a
single derived artifact. Rejected: corpus-wide extraction in one pass (does not fit in
context), and pairwise cross-document analysis at extraction time (quadratic, and we do
not have the time).

*Cost:* no extraction call can see that a later document reversed an earlier decision.
This is the direct cause of D4.

**The whole statements file goes into the answering model's context. No retrieval.**

Rejected: retrieval or embedding-based selection of relevant statements. Rejected for the
MVP because embeddings are a second derived artifact that deletion would have to cascade
to, and because we do not yet know how large the statements file actually is.

*Cost:* a hard ceiling we have not measured. If 45 documents produce more statements than
the context window holds, this design stops working and we will know late. Mitigation:
measure the token count as soon as extraction runs once, and treat it as a stated limit in
the demo rather than a surprise. Candidate successors, in order of preference: a two-stage
scheme where the model first sees a compact index and then loads the statements it needs;
retrieval with embeddings only if that is not enough.

**Deletion redacts a person to a role-class placeholder in the statements file.**

A deleted person's name is replaced with `[former RELEX employee]` or
`[former customer employee]` as appropriate, everywhere it occurs — actor fields, agreed-by
parties, and inside verbatim spans. The statements themselves survive, so the surrounding
decisions keep answering. The system discloses that a deletion has occurred rather than
pretending the record was always anonymous.

Rejected:
- *A UUID placeholder* (`person_a7f3`). Same re-identification problem as below, with none
  of the readability, and a UUID-shaped hole visibly reads as a query-time filter.
- *Dropping every statement by or mentioning the person.* Strongest privacy story,
  but it takes the neighbouring decisions with it, and "then keep answering" is half the
  deletion score.
- *Purging the source documents.* Destroys the corpus and makes the deletion demo
  one-shot.

*Cost, stated plainly:* this is pseudonymisation, not erasure. If only one RELEX
consultant appears in a given meeting, `[former RELEX employee]` identifies them by
elimination, and the surrounding content — their role, their arguments, their quoted words
— is untouched. We are betting that the judges value the decision record surviving over
maximal privacy, and we say so out loud rather than claiming a stronger guarantee than we
have. This belongs in the honest-limits section of the demo, not hidden.

*Conditions this decision depends on:* no re-extraction after a deletion, and no second
derived artifact. Both hold today. If either changes — a summary cache, embeddings, a
re-run of the pipeline — this decision has to be revisited, because the name comes back.

**Currency is out of scope for the MVP.**

We do not classify statements as stale or never-true, and we do not link statements that
supersede or contradict each other. Rejected: a date-sort heuristic, which the brief
explicitly says catches only one of the two cases and would let us report a never-true
record as merely old.

*Cost:* 20% of the rubric, knowingly. Chosen because a half-working currency signal that
mislabels a never-true record is worse than a stated gap — it corrupts the provenance
story, which is worth more. Planned successor: a second LLM pass over the aggregated
statements that groups them by topic, writes explicit supersedes/contradicts links, and
assigns a status. See [roadmap.md](roadmap.md).

## D5 — 2026-09-18 — Accepted
**Citations point at document + page/line + verbatim span.**

Rejected: document-only citations (does not answer "where in it"), and quote-only
citations with a text search in the UI (fragile against the model paraphrasing, and
whitespace in PDFs).

*Cost:* extraction has to track location through PDF parsing, which is the fiddliest part
of the pipeline and the most likely thing to be wrong under time pressure.

## D6 — 2026-09-18 — Accepted
**Speech-act type, actor, and role-as-of-that-document are captured at extraction time.**

Rejected: letting the answering model classify proposal-vs-commitment per query. That
gives different answers to the same question on different days, and the judges ask a
different question set than the practice one.

## D7 — 2026-09-18 — Accepted
**No technical specifications until the dataset is in hand.**

No JSON schema, no endpoint definitions, no file layouts written down yet. The shape of
the real documents — how transcripts mark speakers, whether email threads are one file or
many, how status reports are structured — will change all of them.

*Cost:* implementation starts with a design step instead of a written contract. Accepted
because a wrong contract written today gets followed by three services and a coding agent.

## D8 — 2026-09-18 — Accepted
**Single Verda VM, docker compose, local Ollama. No external model APIs.**

*Cost:* inference speed is bounded by one VM. If extraction over 45 documents turns out to
be too slow, moving Ollama to a separate Verda GPU instance is the escape hatch and
changes nothing above the configuration layer.

## D9 — 2026-09-18 — Accepted
**`uv` for Python dependency management and execution, in every service.**

One tool across all three containers, lockfile committed. Rejected: pip plus venv
per service (slower, and three slightly different setups by Saturday).
